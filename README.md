How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure my software works properly, I do thorough testing, like writing test cases and running them regularly. I also use code reviews and debugging to catch issues early. For security, I follow best practices like validating user input, using secure authentication methods, and keeping dependencies up to date to prevent vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by talking to users or stakeholders to understand what they really want and need from the software. I ask questions, gather feedback, and sometimes create user stories or prototypes to clarify their requirements. Then, I make sure to prioritize features that deliver the most value and keep checking in with users during development to ensure the program meets their expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
I usually begin by planning out the overall structure and breaking down the project into smaller modules or components. I focus on creating a clean, logical design thatâ€™s easy to maintain and expand. I also consider things like user experience, scalability, and security from the start. Using diagrams or flowcharts helps me visualize how everything fits together before I start coding.
